# X-Wing AI
An AI for playing X-Wing in the real world.

## Goals
I have very lofty goals for this.  I may or may not be able to do them all right away since I am still learning much of the technology required to do this.  But hey, that's half the fun right?

- [ ] Use phone / tablet camera to capture an image of the list you are flying (pilots, upgrades, etc)
- [ ] Leverage Tensorflow to recognize the items in the list and expose the list as data
- [ ] Allow user to create a list they want to fly against (either with cards, similar to list import, or by mannually entering)
- [ ] Enable the AI to auto-build a list to fly against (maybe using one of the many meta tracking apps)
- [ ] Use AR to monitor the state of the game board and instruct the user on how to move AI ships / place asteroids and debris
- [ ] Enable next move hinting
- [ ] Customizable difficulty setting
